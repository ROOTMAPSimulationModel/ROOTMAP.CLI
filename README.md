# ROOTMAP.CLI

This is a Windows C++ command-line application for running headless ROOTMAP simulations. It does not include the simulation model code - that's in ROOTMAP.Core.

## How to build

Compile it with Visual Studio 2017. Other IDEs (Visual Studio 2019, Visual Studio 2015, Jetbrains Rider etc.) may work but have not been tested. All dependencies will be automatically obtained via NuGet package.
